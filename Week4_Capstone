# Business Problem

The Chang's have planned to migrate to Toronto, Canada. They have been running a family hospitality business for many years in China.
Since they are moving to Toronto, they are planning on opening their hospitality business in that city, where they can make their business
grow and profit. This is a new place for them, so they aren't sure where the location is for opening a Chinese restaurant. Therefore, the
objective of our project is to help the Chang's with finding a great location for opening a business.

# Data description

First and foremost, we will need to use the Foursquare location data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)
and postal code list data (Geospatial Coordinates data) in conjunction with each other. The Wikipedia website contains the Canadian 
postal code starting with the letter M and the corresponding Borough and Neighborhood. This list gets consolidated with the Geospatial Coordinates
data which includes the longitude and latitude of the Neighborhoods. We then explore the neighborhoods in Toronto using the Foursquare location data.
We will ask the stakeholders for a preference of location, and depending on that, we cluster the neighborhoods by the different suburbs.
This is essential as by clustering, we can identify and group similar data points in larger datasets without concern for the specific outcome.
After analysing the dataframe, we can suggest different locations to the Chang's.
