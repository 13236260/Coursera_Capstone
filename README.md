# Business problem
The Chang's have planned to migrate to Toronto, Canada. They have been running a family hospitality business for many years in China.
Since they are moving to Toronto, they are planning on opening their hospitality business in that city, where they can make their business
grow and profit. This is a new place for them, so they aren't sure where the location is for opening a Chinese restaurant. Therefore, the
objective of our project is to help the Chang's with finding a great location for opening a business.
